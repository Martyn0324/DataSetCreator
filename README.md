# DatasetCreator
Dataset creator for Neural Networks.
This is a Work In Progress - the code may have some problems since I didn't test it in the class and funcion forms so far, I've only directly and manually made all the processes you can find in main.py

This repository is not a big deal. It's just some kind of annotation/tutorial so I can check it and remember how I should mount my dataset...and can also be a utility module, I guess...

PS: I barely tested if the dataset created through these functions actually works in a Neural Network. The only test I did were in a DCGAN...which didn't converge at all. Feel free to test it out.
