# DatasetCreator
Dataset creator for Neural Networks.
This is a Work In Progress - the code may have some problems since I didn't test it in the class and funcion forms so far, I've only directly and manually made all the processes you can find in main.py

This repository is no big deal. It's just some kind of annotation/tutorial so I can check it and remember how I should mount my dataset...and can also be a utility module, I guess...

If you want to use it, simply download it and use `from DatasetCreator.main import DatasetCreator`...or you could also copy+paste it into your own file.

PS: Beware of `PIL.Image.DecompressionBombError`!
