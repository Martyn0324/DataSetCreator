# DatasetCreator
Dataset creator for Neural Networks.
This is a Work In Progress - the code may have some problems, but I think it might it should be helpful at least when dealing with images(I've been using the image functions intensively...thanks GANs)

This repository is no big deal. It's just some kind of annotation/tutorial so I can check it and remember how I should mount my dataset...and can also be a utility module, I guess...

If you want to use it, simply download it and use `from DatasetCreator.main import DatasetCreator`...or you could also copy+paste it into your own file.

PS: Beware of `PIL.Image.DecompressionBombError`!
